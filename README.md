Advanced_time_series_forecasting__with_prophet_and_bayesian_optimization
Project Overview:
This project demonstrates an advanced time series forecasting pipeline using Facebook Prophet combined with Bayesian Optimization (Optuna) to achieve improved forecasting accuracy beyond default model settings.
The main objective is to move past baseline forecasting by systematically tuning Prophet’s hyperparameters and evaluating performance using robust time series metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and WAPE.
The project uses a synthetically generated complex dataset that includes:

 -> Multiple seasonal patterns
 -> Long-term trend
 -> Random noise
 -> Injected anomalies (spikes and dips)
This setup closely simulates real-world business time series data such as electricity demand, stock prices, or sales forecasting.

Key Objectives:
Generate a complex multi-seasonal time series dataset
Build a baseline Prophet model using default parameters
Apply Bayesian Optimization to tune Prophet hyperparameters
Train a final optimized Prophet model
Compare baseline vs optimized models using standard evaluation metrics
Visualize forecast results

Technologies Used:
-> Python
-> Facebook Prophet
-> Optuna (Bayesian Optimization)
-> NumPy & Pandas
-> Scikit-learn
-> Matplotlib

Project Workflow:
1️. Synthetic Data Generation
A daily time series dataset is programmatically created with:
Linear trend
Yearly seasonality
Weekly seasonality
Gaussian noise
Five artificial anomalies (spikes/dips)
This ensures the model is tested on a challenging and realistic dataset.

2️. Data Splitting
The dataset is divided into:
Training set (70%)
Validation set (15%)
Test set (15%)
This allows fair model evaluation and prevents data leakage.

3️. Baseline Model
A baseline Prophet model is trained using default configuration:
Yearly seasonality enabled
Weekly seasonality enabled
Daily seasonality disabled
Baseline performance metrics are computed on the validation set.

4️.Bayesian Optimization with Optuna
Bayesian Optimization is applied to efficiently search the hyperparameter space and minimize RMSE.
Optimized parameters include:
seasonality_prior_scale
changepoint_prior_scale
holidays_prior_scale
Optuna intelligently balances exploration and exploitation, making it more efficient than grid or random search.

5. Final Optimized Model
Using the best hyperparameters found by Optuna:
The model is retrained on training + validation data
Forecasts are generated for the test set
Final performance metrics are computed

6. Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics are used for comparison:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
WAPE (Weighted Absolute Percentage Error)
These metrics provide a comprehensive view of forecasting accuracy and robustness.

7. Results Comparison
A side-by-side comparison clearly shows the performance gains achieved through Bayesian Optimization over the baseline Prophet model.

8. Visualization
The final section visualizes:
Actual test values
Optimized Prophet forecasts
This helps in visually validating model performance.

Sample Output:
Baseline vs Optimized performance table
Best hyperparameters identified by Optuna
Forecast plot comparing predicted and actual values

How to Run the Project:
Install Dependencies
pip install prophet optuna scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib

Run the Script
python main.py

Key Takeaways:
Default forecasting models can often be significantly improved with proper tuning
Bayesian Optimization provides an efficient and scalable approach for hyperparameter search
Prophet is highly effective for multi-seasonal time series with anomalies
A structured evaluation strategy ensures reliable and reproducible results

Future Enhancements:
Add real-world datasets (electricity load, sales, stock prices)
Introduce holiday effects
Compare Prophet with ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM models
Use cross-validation instead of single validation split
